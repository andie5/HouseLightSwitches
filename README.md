This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Component called House which models a home with 4 rooms, each with its own light and light switch. Uses state to keep track of whether each light is on or off.
Add 4 buttons to represent the lightswitches, and flips the respective light on or off when the buttons are clicked.
